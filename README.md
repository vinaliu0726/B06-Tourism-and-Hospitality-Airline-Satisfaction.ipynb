In this project, I cleaned and merged two datasets — dot_delays.csv and Airline_review_USOnly_Updated.csv — to integrate U.S. Department of Transportation flight delay data with customer review data for comprehensive airline performance analysis.

**Key Findings**
- First and Business Class receive the highest ratings across most satisfaction factors. Business Class outperforms First Class in some areas, such as inflight_entertainment, wifi_connectivity and value_for_money.
- Premium Economy and Economy share similar rating profiles, suggesting that the upgrade may not deliver a significantly enhanced experience across satisfaction factors.
